# Kartra Review 2025 : All-in-One Platform Really Worth Trying?

When I first discovered Kartra, I was overwhelmed by the chaos of using too many tools—Mailchimp for emails, ClickFunnels for landing pages, Teachable for courses, and a stack of other platforms barely holding it all together.

If that sounds like your setup, you’re not alone.

Running an online business shouldn’t feel like managing a tech circus.

That’s why I decided to give Kartra a real shot—and after months of using it across my own business and client projects, I’ve learned exactly where it shines and where it doesn’t.

In this Kartra review, I’ll walk you through its key features, pricing, pros and cons, and who it’s actually built for.

Let’s get into it.

## What Is Kartra?

Kartra is an all-in-one platform designed to help small businesses and entrepreneurs sell their products or services online.

It allows you to build websites, landing pages, sales funnels, email campaigns, and even online courses—all without needing to know how to code.

Launched by Genesis Digital, the same company behind WebinarJam and EverWebinar, Kartra combines multiple essential marketing tools into one seamless experience.

## Who Is Kartra For?

Kartra is a great fit for entrepreneurs, small business owners, and digital marketers who want to manage everything in one place.

It’s especially useful if you’re handling things like building websites, sending emails, selling products, and supporting customers on your own.

If you're feeling overwhelmed by using too many separate tools, Kartra offers a simpler, more organized way to run your online business.

## What Does Kartra Provide?

### 1. Website and Landing Page Builder

One of the best things about Kartra is how easy it makes building pages.

Using a drag-and-drop editor, you can quickly create professional-looking websites, landing pages, sales pages, or opt-in forms—without needing any coding skills.

It comes with a wide range of templates that you can customize to fit your brand.

Everything is mobile-friendly, so your site looks great on any device right from the start.

While it may not be as flashy as tools like Elementor, it’s powerful, clean, and built to convert.

### 2. Sales Funnels and Campaign Builder

Creating sales funnels in Kartra is super simple.

Whether you're launching a product or running a lead generation campaign, Kartra gives you ready-made funnel templates to work with.

You can map out each step of your customer's journey—from landing page to checkout—and track how people move through your funnel.

You can also A/B test different versions to see what works best and improve your conversion rates.

### 3. Email Marketing & Automation

Email is still one of the most effective ways to grow an online business, and Kartra takes it seriously.

It has a built-in email system that lets you send personalized emails based on your audience’s behavior.

You can automate follow-ups, send targeted broadcasts, and tag users depending on what actions they take (like clicking a link, watching a video, or buying something).

Everything works together smoothly because it’s all under one system no need for outside email software.

### 4. Membership Sites and Online Courses

If you sell online courses, memberships, or subscription-based content, Kartra makes it easy to manage.You can create multiple membership levels, drip out content over time, and give users access based on their subscription.

Everything is hosted inside Kartra, so you don’t need an extra platform like Teachable or Kajabi.You also get helpful insights like where members drop off, so you can improve the learning experience.

### 5. Checkout System and Payments

Selling products or services?

Kartra Checkouts handles everything from payments to upsells. You can sell digital or physical products, offer one-time purchases or subscriptions, and even create product bundles.

It supports Stripe and PayPal, and includes affiliate tracking built in no extra tools required. You can also test different checkout designs to see what converts best.

### 6. Video Hosting with Built-In Actions

One feature that sets Kartra apart is its built-in video hosting.

Instead of paying for third-party platforms like Vimeo or Wistia, you can upload and use your videos directly inside Kartra.

Even better?

You can add CTAs (calls to action), email opt-ins, or automation triggers based on how much of the video someone watches.

This is super helpful for webinars, VSLs (video sales letters), and training content—especially when you want to follow up with viewers automatically.

## 7. Helpdesk and Customer Support Tools

Kartra isn’t just about selling—it also helps you support your customers.
