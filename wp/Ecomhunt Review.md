Even paying for overpriced product lists that were outdated by the time I got them.

That’s why I decided to try **Ecomhunt**.

In this **Ecomhunt review**, I’ll walk you through what it is, how I used it, what I liked, what could be better, and whether or not I think it’s worth your time and money.

## Why I Started Using Ecomhunt?

I started using Ecomhunt out of sheer **frustration**.

Back then, I had just failed with two dropshipping products.

I had no idea how to spot trends early.

And I was tired of spending hours scrolling AliExpress or browsing sketchy Facebook pages, hoping to find the next “shiny object.”

A fellow eCom friend casually said, “Dude, just try Ecomhunt. It’s not perfect, but it saves you time.”

So I signed up.

And truth be told?

That one small decision helped me launch a product that made over $1,200 in sales in the first month, with almost zero research time.

Here’s what impressed me:

On the flip side, if you already have an established private label brand or a unique product line, this tool might not be for you.

Let’s be fair—no tool is perfect.

Here are some downsides I noticed:

- **It’s not plug-and-play.** You still need to run proper ads, set up your store, and create custom creatives.  
- **Some product links lead to unreliable AliExpress sellers.** You still need to vet your suppliers.  

But honestly?

These are small issues compared to the time it saves you.
